# Bitwise-Operation
In C, the following 6 operators are bitwise operators (also known as bit operators as they work at the bit-level). They are used to perform bitwise operations in C.
 

- 1.The __& (bitwise AND)__ in C or C++ takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.  
- 2.The __| (bitwise OR)__ in C or C++ takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1. 
- 3.The __^ (bitwise XOR)__ in C or C++ takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different. 
- 4.The __<< (left shift)__ in C or C++ takes two numbers, the left shifts the bits of the first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
- 5.The __>> (right shift)__ in C or C++ takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
- 6.The __~ (bitwise NOT)__ in C or C++ takes one number and inverts all bits of it.
